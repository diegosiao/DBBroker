  A lightweight and user-friendly .NET tool and library for effortless database records manipulation.

## Philosophy

First and foremost, there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution.

That being said, DBBroker offers features that benefit any kind of application, from the simplest to the most complex, particularly in security-restricted scenarios. Here are some key requirements it addresses:

- Applications should NOT be responsible for executing [DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language)..

- Applications' Data Access Objects should act as clients to the database, not the other way around.

- [Schema Migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration) are not an option due to a development process led by Database Administrators.

These are common needs for many organizations with database-centered solutions, such as the one where this tool was initially developed.

## Quick Start

Open your terminal and navigate to your application's *.csproj directory. Then follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Install `DBBroker.Cli` .NET tool globally.

```bash
dotnet install DBBroker.Cli -g
```

**Step 2:** Add `DBBroker` package to your project.

```bash
dotnet nuget add DBBroker
```

**Step 3:** Create a `dbbroker.config.json` file at the root of your project.

```bash
dotnet dbbroker init --namespace="EShop.DataModels" --connection-string "[your-connection-string]" --provider Oracle
```

**Step 4:** Synchronize your project with your database to generate the Data Models.

```bash
dotnet dbbroker sync
```

## Examples

Entity persistence.

```C#
// Data Models classes are generated by DBBroker
var customer = new CustomersDataModel();
customer.Name = "John Three Sixteen";
customer.Birthday = new DateTime(1980, 3, 16);

var id = await _dbBroker.InsertAsync(customer);
```

Entity persistence with transactions.

```C#
using var connection = new SqlConnection();
connection.Open();
var transaction = connection.GetTransaction();

try 
{
    var customer = new CustomersDataModel();
    customer.Id = Guid.NewGuid();
    customer.Name = "John Three Sixteen";
    customer.Birthday = new DateTime(1980, 3, 16);

    await connection.InsertAsync(customer, transaction);

    var car = new CarEdm();
    car.Model = "Renault Twingo";
    car.Year = 2001;
    car.CustomerId = customer.Id;

    await connection.InsertAsync(car, transaction);
    transaction.Commit();
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
    transaction.Rollback();
}
```

Retrieving a record.

```C#
var customer = await connection.GetByKey<CustomersDataModel>("543491fa-788a-474c-9f3b-6ed6566e5d2c");
```

Retrieving multiple and filtered records.

```C#
var inactiveCustomers = await connection.Select<CustomersDataModel>()
  .AddFilter(x => x.StatusId, SqlEquals.To(3))
  .FetchFirst(records: 100, skip: 300) // helps implement a 'load more' strategy
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

```C#
// another example with columns
```

```C#
// another example with columns and order by
```
